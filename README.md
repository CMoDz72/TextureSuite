Farming Simulator Texture Toolkit
=================================

This toolkit contains 3 standalone tools used to create parallax-ready textures for Farming Simulator.

TOOLS INCLUDED
--------------

1) Height Map Tool
   Converts a diffuse/albedo texture into a grayscale height map.

2) Normal Map Tool
   Converts a height map into a tangent-space normal map.
   Includes DirectX/OpenGL green channel toggle.

3) Parallax Tool
   Combines normal + height maps into Farming Simulator parallax DDS format.

WORKFLOW
--------

Diffuse → Height Tool → Normal Tool → Parallax Tool

All tools export DDS textures ready for the game.

No installation required. Just run the EXE files.

Created for the Farming Simulator modding community.

** End goal is to package it all into the one EXE. **
